        <h2>Soil Data</h2>
        <h2><i>Importance of Soil
        </i></h2>
        <li>Soil allows the growth of plants. It supplies water and nutrients that are required in the growth of plants.</li>

           <li>The soil is the main part of agriculture. Different types of soils support different kinds of crops. Without agriculture, food, shelter and clothing are not possible.</li> 
            
           <li> Many microorganisms live in the soil.</li>
            
           <li>Underground water is used for various purposes.</li>
       
       <h2>Soil Profile</h2>
       <p>The soil consists of distinct layers which are also called Horizons of the Soil.

        The Soil Profile is a vertical section of the soil which depicts all the layers of the soil. The layers of the soil can be seen if we dig deep through it like while creating a well or while laying the foundation of a building.</p>
          <li>Humus – The decaying matter in the soil is called Humus.</li>

           <li> Weathering - Soil is formed when rocks break down. This process is also called Weathering. The weathering of rocks takes place because of rains, flowing water, winds, temperature and climatic conditions of a place.</li>
            
           <li> Parent Rock - The nature of the soil that is its texture and availability of minerals depends upon the rock from which it is formed. This rock is often called as the Parent Rock.</li>

        <h2>Weather Data</h2>
        <p>Agriculture weather is critical for securing the yield of most field crops. However, farmers and landowners who rely on publicly available agriculture weather data often find that the forecasts made by these sources don’t match up with what they see in their fields. This disparity might result in heavy losses, especially when severe weather strikes unexpectedly. Therefore, growers should only use agriculture weather forecasts that have been carefully compiled, specifically for their fields, using data from meteo stations, sensors, and satellites.</p>

<p>When we remark on the crucial role of weather in agriculture, we are not exaggerating; in fact, we may be understating its significance. If you want to maximize your agricultural output and <u>increase crop yields</u> , you must work in conjunction with the meteo conditions.

    Weather has a significant impact on the prevalence of pests and diseases, the availability of water, and the amount of fertilizer needed to grow crops. Farmers rely on climate patterns and weather forecasting in agriculture to determine which crops to cultivate and when to sow them. The majority of farming techniques depend on favorable meteorological conditions. As an illustration, precision irrigation relies on the amount of rain that falls on a field, <u>soil solarization</u> requires high temperatures, etc.</p>
 <h2><i>What is the relationship between weather, climate, and agriculture?</i></h2>
    <p><i><u>Climate change and agriculture</u> are intertwined in crucial ways. If temperatures rise, farmers may be able to reap the benefits of growing crops suited to their climate or move to growing crops more suited to warmer regions. If the increased temperature is higher than optimal for a given crop, however, agriculture production will suffer. In general, it may become more challenging to cultivate crops in the same manner and locations as a result of climate change .</i></p>
<p>Farmers most frequently use short-range forecasts, which are predictions made between 1 and 7 days in advance. In the meantime, medium-range (up to a month), long-range (up to a year), and hazardous weather forecasts for agriculture can all be extremely helpful in field activity planning. Even though severe weather can come abruptly, wreaking havoc on crops and even impacting the viability of seeds in storage, local meteorological forecasts help farmers prepare for these events, minimizing or even eliminating their harmful effects.</p>
<h2>How Does Weather Affect Agriculture?</h2>
<p>Most crops grown in fields rely entirely on rain and sunshine for their survival. Meteo conditions also affect the well-being and food availability of livestock.

    Agriculture losses from severe weather can be devastating. High temperatures, low rainfall, flooding, and sudden freezes negatively affect crops, particularly during the most vulnerable<u>stages of plant growth,</u>  such as seed germination. Studies have shown that drought is typically a major reason for decreased grain yields and economic losses on farms .
    
    Indirect effects of weather on agriculture crops include shifts in soil processes, dynamics of nitrogen uptake, and the spread of pest populations.<u>Soil erosion nutrient deficiency</u>  and  due to heavy rain and the opposite phenomenon,<u>soil salinization</u>  during the dry spell, are all examples of the indirect impact of weather on agriculture.
    
    With all of the potential direct and indirect effects of meteo conditions, agriculture producers should plan ahead of time and count on accurate and dependable data.</p>
<h2>Why Is Public Weather Station Data Insufficient For Agricultural Needs?</h2>
<p>Given the significance of agricultural weather forecast accuracy, it’s easy to see why companies and organizations in this sector are so eager to acquire the best available information. With multiple open-access public sources, it may seem that they might just pick one to obtain their desired agricultural meteorological reports. However, big players in the agriculture industry prefer reliable agricultural weather stations and data providers for one main reason: accurate data helps them increase profits while spending less.

    Generally, meteorological stations covering a certain territory around them are the source of global weather data for agriculture monitoring, and the bigger the distance, the less accurate the forecast is. Typical forecasting models allow for prognoses based on specific conditions and their combinations. However, such suggestions are far from precise and cannot always assist in making the right decisions or insuring risks in agriculture.
    
    Say, for instance, that a certain field’s crops don’t receive adequate moisture despite the fact that rain is forecast for the area. This is an example of why public weather data is insufficient for agriculture.
